<h1> Create a new Author Feature: Comming Soon! </h1>
<h3>  I mean, basically, the create/edit/delete book stuff was elaborate enough that I don't feel like spending any time doing the same thing for the authors.  The code would be highly repeditive and I don't (yet) know how to refactor it so that I can meet the project requirements for a purely 'restful' URL system.  For example; the easiest thing would be to create a "GET" request for "/books/create-or-modify" and then combine the create & edit controller actions, but when I went down that road I ended up with question marks "?" in my URL's. </h3>
